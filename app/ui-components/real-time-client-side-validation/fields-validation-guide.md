Below is a **beginner-friendly** explanation on how to incorporate the Bootstrap **`is-valid`** class into your form so that valid fields appear with a green border (and possibly a green check icon in some themes), just like how invalid fields appear with a red border using `is-invalid`.

---

## 1. What is `is-valid`?

- In **Bootstrap**, `is-valid` is a class that styles an input field to indicate it has passed validation.  
- Typically, you add `is-valid` to an input when you know the user’s entry is acceptable (no errors).  
- Combined with `is-invalid`, it helps users see at a glance which fields are valid and which need correction.

---

## 2. How You Use `is-invalid` Currently

Right now, you have something like:
```jsx
<input
  type="text"
  className={`form-control form-control-sm small-placeholder ${
    formErrors.postingTitle ? 'is-invalid' : ''
  }`}
  name="postingTitle"
  value={formData.postingTitle}
  onChange={handleInputChange}
/>
<div className="invalid-feedback">{formErrors.postingTitle}</div>
```
- If `formErrors.postingTitle` has an error message, the input gets `is-invalid`.
- Otherwise, the input is styled normally (no error state).

---

## 3. Adding `is-valid` Conditionally

We want to add `is-valid` if **all** of these conditions are true for a given field:
1. The user has typed something (or selected a value).  
2. The value has passed your validation (i.e., no errors in `formErrors[fieldName]`).  

### Simple Approach

The easiest method is a **ternary** (similar to how you handle `is-invalid`) that checks if:
- There is **no** error for this field, AND
- The user has already typed something.

For example, you could do:

```jsx
<input
  type="text"
  className={`form-control form-control-sm small-placeholder ${
    formErrors.postingTitle ? 'is-invalid' : formData.postingTitle ? 'is-valid' : ''
  }`}
  name="postingTitle"
  value={formData.postingTitle}
  onChange={handleInputChange}
/>
```

#### Explanation
1. If `formErrors.postingTitle` **is not empty**, we add `is-invalid`.  
2. Else if `formData.postingTitle` **has a value**, we add `is-valid`.  
3. Otherwise, we add no special class.

> **Note**: With this approach, the field will turn green as soon as there’s **any** non-empty value (assuming no validation error). If you want more nuanced logic, see the **“Advanced Approach”** below.

## 4. Adjusting This for Each Field

You’ll do the same for every field. For instance, your salary input might look like:

```jsx
<input
  type="text"
  className={`form-control form-control-sm small-placeholder ${
    formErrors.salary 
      ? 'is-invalid' 
      : formData.salary 
        ? 'is-valid' 
        : ''
  }`}
  name="salary"
  value={formData.salary}
  onChange={handleInputChange}
/>
<div className="invalid-feedback">{formErrors.salary}</div>
```

1. We check if `formErrors.salary` exists; if yes, apply `is-invalid`.  
2. Else if `formData.salary` is not an empty string, apply `is-valid`.  
3. If neither of those conditions are met, leave it as the default style.

## 5. Advanced Approach: Tracking “Touched” Fields

One common pattern is to track whether a field has been **touched** (focused and changed) by the user at least once. That way, you can display the green `is-valid` only after the user has interacted with the field and it has passed validation.

### Example Implementation

1. **Add a `touchedFields` state**:
   ```jsx
   const [touchedFields, setTouchedFields] = useState({});
   ```
2. **Update `touchedFields` in `handleInputChange`**:
   ```jsx
   const handleInputChange = (e) => {
     const { name, value, type, checked, files } = e.target;

     setFormData((prevData) => ({
       ...prevData,
       [name]: type === "checkbox" 
                  ? checked 
                  : type === "file" 
                    ? files 
                    : value,
     }));

     // Mark this field as touched
     setTouchedFields((prev) => ({ ...prev, [name]: true }));

     validateField(name, value, type);
   };
   ```
3. **Check for validity**:
   ```jsx
   const getInputClassName = (fieldName) => {
     if (!touchedFields[fieldName]) {
       // If user hasn't touched the field yet, do nothing special
       return '';
     }

     return formErrors[fieldName] ? 'is-invalid' : 'is-valid';
   };
   ```
4. **Use `getInputClassName` in JSX**:
   ```jsx
   <input
     type="text"
     className={`form-control form-control-sm small-placeholder ${getInputClassName('postingTitle')}`}
     name="postingTitle"
     value={formData.postingTitle}
     onChange={handleInputChange}
   />
   ```

With this **Advanced Approach**:
- Before the user interacts with a field, no validation styles appear.  
- After the user types (or focuses and leaves the field), it gets marked as “touched.”  
- If it’s valid, you’ll see `is-valid`; if it’s invalid, `is-invalid`.

## 6. Key Points to Remember

1. **One or the Other**: Generally, you don’t add both `is-invalid` and `is-valid` to the same element at once. It’s usually a ternary or a function that returns either `is-invalid` or `is-valid` or empty.  
2. **Conditional Logic**: You decide under what conditions a field is considered valid or invalid (e.g., non-empty, passes certain rules).  
3. **Immediate vs. On-Blur**: Some forms show validation as soon as you type; others only show it after leaving the field or on submit. Choose the user experience you prefer.  
4. **Style Provided by Bootstrap**: These classes rely on Bootstrap to actually style the borders green or red. If you’re using a different CSS framework or a custom setup, you’ll need the equivalent classes or your own styling.

## Conclusion

To add **`is-valid`**:
1. **Check** if the field has no errors (`!formErrors[fieldName]`).  
2. **Optionally** check if the user has given an acceptable value (e.g., non-empty, meets min length).  
3. **Conditionally** apply the `is-valid` class.  

This approach gives users immediate feedback that their entries are **good to go** (green border) or **need fixing** (red border), improving the overall user experience.
